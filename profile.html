        <p class="no-first-of">I'm Alex, a digital designer from St Albans. I've recently graduated with a first in Web Design from Southampton Solent University. Since starting on the web in 2010 as a freelancer, I've worked with various clients from a range of industries such as music and education. I also have experience in both more traditional advertising and digital agencies.</p>
