# Hi there!
This is the source code of my [personal site](http://alexpate.uk).

## What's the point of this repo?
This repo is more for me. However, when I was first learning web development I learnt a lot looking at other developers code. Hopefully by open sourcing this, someone might find it useful. If you do, would love it if you would let [me know](http://twitter.com/alexjpate)!

## The workflow
- Local development
- Commit changes to GitHub
- GitHub sends posthook to my server
- Server pulls latest master and runs `jekyll build` and any other related functions (bundle)

## Say hello!
Feel free to say hello over on twitter [@alexjpate](http://twitter.com/alexjpate).

## To-do list
- General speed optimisation
- Sort out FOUT (TypeKit)
- Remove excess css
